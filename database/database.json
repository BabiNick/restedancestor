She quaffed all manner of strange fungii, herbs and concoctions, intent on gaining some insight into the horror we both knew to be growing beneath us.

In the face of my increasingly egregious flaunting of public taboos, awe turned to ire, and demonstrations were held in the town square"
  },
  {
    "quote": "The wild whispers of heresy roused the rabble to violent action. Such was the general air of rebellion, that even my generous offer of gold to the local constabulary was rebuffed. To reassert my rule, I sought out unscrupulous men skilled in the application of force. Tight-lipped and terrifying, these mercenaries brought with them a war machine of terrible implication."
  },
  {
    "quote": "Eager to end the tiresome domestic distraction, I instructed my newly formed militia of hardened bandits, brigands and killers to go forth and do their work. Compliance and order were restored, and annoysome population of the Hamlet was culled to more... Manageable numbers."

  {
    "quote": "The ways and rituals of blood sacrifice are difficult to master. Those from beyond require a physical vessel, if they are to make the crossing into our reality.

  {
    "quote": "My first attempts at summoning were crude and the results disappointing. I soon found however, that the type and condition of the host's meat was a critical factor. The best results came from pigs, whose flesh is most like that of men."

    "quote": "The great thing I had managed to bring through was brutish and stupid. Moreover, it required prodigious amounts of meat to sustain itself. But this is only a trifling concern. After all, I had a village full of it."

  {
    "quote": "My zeal for blood rituals and summoning rites had begun to ebb, as each attempt invariably brought only failure and disappointment. Progress was halting, and the rapidly accumulating surplus of wasted flesh had become... Burdensome."
  },
  {
    "quote": "I could not store such a prodigious amount of offal, not could I rid myself of it easily, possessed, as it was, by unnamable things from outer spheres. When excavations beneath the manor broke through into an ancient network of aqueducts and tunnels, I knew I had found a solution to the problem of disposal."
  },
  {
    "quote": "The spasmodically squirming, braying and snorting half-corpses were heaped each upon the other until at last I was rid of them. The Warrens had become a landfill of snout and hoof, bristle and bone. A mountainous, twitching mass of misshapen flesh, fusing itself together, in the darkness."
  },
  {
    "quote": "My lofty position wasn't always accompanied by the fear of office, and there was a time, when I could walk the streets or raise a glass at the tavern, without concern for molestation. Faithful, as the tide, one precocious village waif made it her hobby to shadow my every errand. It was charming, then. Troublesome, later."
  },
  {
    "quote": "In financial desperation I've struck a bargain with the ancient things, that surfaced in search of sacrifice, when the moon was right. Their price was the delivery of an obscure idol and one other item of troubling portent. The pact struck, my new found accomplices slipped silently beneath the brackish water. A fearful stirring at the edge of the torchlight betrayed a familiar witness and gifted me with malign inspiration."
  },
  {
    "quote": "Under the blood moon I lured my wide-eyed prey to the pier's edge. Before she could properly appreciate her position I clamped down a manacle, chaining her to the leering idol. A small push was sufficient to send both into the icy waters. And one at length the tide receded, jewels of the most magnificent grandeur lay scattered upon the shore."
  },
  {
    "quote": "Prying eyes had become a nuisance along the Old Road, and so I undertook to receive my most curious deliveries by a way of marine shipments. A sheltered jetty was accessible by a narrow stone stair off the back of the manor, and the discrete system of pulleys could hoist even the heaviest prizes up the rock face from the securely tied dingy below."
  },
  {
    "quote": "I employed a crew of particularly unsavory mariners, who, for a time, sailed the four corners at my behest, retrieving many valuable artifacts, relics and rare texts. Predictably, they increased their tariffs to counter my intense stipulation of secrecy. Such resources had long been exhausted, of course, and so I prepared an alternative payment."
  },
  {
    "quote": "While the greedy dogs slept off their revelry, I hexed their anchor with every twisted incantation I could master, imbuing it with the weight of my ambition and my contempt for their crude extortion. At the witching hour, the anchor pulled with preternatural force, dragging craft and crew down into the depths. They must have cried out, but no sound escaped the swirling black waters..."
